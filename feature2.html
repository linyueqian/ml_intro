            <h2>Thus, the computer can learn from the data to make predictions from extracting the features from the data.</h2>
            <p>The training sample is often transformend into a string of numbers. And features are usually extracted from the numbers. Algorithms like nearest neighbor, linear regression, and logistic regression can be used to make predictions.</p>
            <h2>For example, in <span class="underline">speech recognition</span>, the computer can learn from the features in sound waves to recognize the speech.</h2>
            <h2>Also, in <span class="underline">spam detection</span>, the computer can learn from the features in the text to classify the email as spam or not.</h2>
            <h2>Now, let's look at another example where the computer can learn from the features and make predictions on <span class="underline">continuous values.</span>             <a class="point" href="price.html">&rarr;</a></h2>
