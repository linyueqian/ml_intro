                    continuous value. For example,
                    predicting the price of a house based on its size, or predicting the number of sales of a product
                    based
                    on the amount of advertising spent on it. Regression is used to predict a continuous value, such as
                    the
                    price of a house, the number of sales of a product, or the number of students in a class. Regression
                    is
                    used to predict a continuous value, such as the price of a house, the number of sales of a product,
                    or
                    the number of students in a class. Regression is used to predict a continuous value, such as the
