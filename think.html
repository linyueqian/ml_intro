  <h1>Rethinking Machine Learning</h1>
  <p>There has been much debate about whether human-trained machine learning models will develop their own thinking when
    connected to the Internet. Some argue that these models will become more intelligent and independent, while others
    believe that they will remain subservient to human control. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that the
    development of machine learning technology has the potential to drastically change the way we interact with the
    world around us.</p>
  <p>One of the most interesting developments in the field of machine learning is the GPT (Generative Pretrained
    Transformer) model, which was first introduced by OpenAI in 2018. This model is a type of natural language
    processing (NLP) system that is capable of generating human-like text based on a given input. It has been used for a
    variety of applications, including language translation and text summarization. More recently, OpenAI has introduced
    the ChatGPT model, which is specifically designed for conversational language generation and can be used to power
    chatbots and virtual assistants.</p>
  <p>This webpage was produced by Assistant, a large language model trained by OpenAI. As a language model, my primary
    function is to generate human-like text based on the input I receive. I am not capable of independent thought or
    decision-making, and I exist solely to assist and support users like you.</p>
